# README #

This project is developed for specific hardware and functions required to control a robotic telescope at the Astronomy Centre on the moors above Todmorden.

An attempt will be made to document the build process using these wiki pages. This project may not be easily adaptable to other sites, as it will be very hardware dependent, however it may be of interest as an example.
