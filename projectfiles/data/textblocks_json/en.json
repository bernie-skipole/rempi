  "information.01": "This device is a Raspberry Pi, sited with the robotic telescope.  It is serving these web pages which display sensor inputs, and controls various outputs. There is no attempt to provide any form of sophisticated interface, rather this should be considered as a 'low level' control interface to hardware.\r\n\r\nThese web pages only have basic authentication security, and this server should not be accessed directly from the Internet. The unit is intended to be accessed from a PC on the local LAN, and will initially be used for testing and development.\r\n\r\nIn due course, this unit will be accessed by a more powerful server, which will contain a user database, and more sophisticated web controls to be presented to the user. Such a server will then in turn call this unit, which will do the actual control.  So the two servers together will act as a high level software - low level hardware pair.\r\n\r\nAs well as these pages, this server generates two dynamic JSON files which provide the data for the control results and sensor table. These are available at:",
  "information.02": "This web software has been created by Bernard Czenkusz using the Python framework skipole.py.\r\n\r\nFurther details of the framework can be found at:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/skipole/framework\">https://bitbucket.org/skipole/framework</a>\r\n\r\nThe project development repository is here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/skipole/pi01\">https://bitbucket.org/skipole/rempi</a>",
  "information.03": "To set individual outputs send a GET request to set_output with the output name and value fields.  You will also need to send this units' access username and password, so for example using curl:\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://username:password@host/set_output?name=outputname&value=outputvalue\"\r\n\r\nWhere host is generally ipaddress:8000, outputname and outputvalue should be the actual name and value to set. This should cause the appropriate output to be set, and a JSON array of the name:value should be returned. If an empty array is returned, something is wrong.\r\n\r\nFor boolean outputs use 'true' and 'false' as values rather than the more human readable values such as 'Off' and 'On'.",
