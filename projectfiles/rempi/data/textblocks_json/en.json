You will also need to send this unit's access username and password, so for example using curl:\r\n\r\ncurl \"http://username:password@host/set_output?name=outputname&value=outputvalue\"\r\n\r\nWhere host is generally the ip address of the pi, outputname and outputvalue should be the actual name and value to set. This should cause the appropriate output to be set, and a JSON array of the name:value should be returned. If an empty array is returned, something is wrong.\r\n\r\nFor boolean outputs use 'true' and 'false' as values rather than the more human readable values such as 'Off' and 'On'.",
